# Skip rules that conflict with our architecture:
# - var-naming[no-role-prefix]: We intentionally use shared variables (service_user,
#   node_type, external_ip, etc.) across roles via group_vars. Prefixing every
#   variable with the role name would break this cross-role variable sharing design.
# - command-instead-of-module: Some mount/disk checks intentionally use shell
#   for flexibility that the mount module doesn't provide.
