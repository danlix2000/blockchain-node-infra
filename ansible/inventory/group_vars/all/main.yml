# Do NOT set haproxy_domain here. Each node gets its own domain from Terraform.
# Flow: nodes.tfvars (domain field) -> Route 53 A record -> Ansible host variable.
# Setting it here would force the same domain on every node, which is almost
# never what you want. Leave this commented out.

# Set a real email before enabling HAProxy TLS (Let's Encrypt rejects example.com).
